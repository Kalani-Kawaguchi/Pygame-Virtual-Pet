<br>

The 'pet' is a circle that has some values, the most important being its **Health** and **Happiness**.<br>
**Health** of the 'pet' corresponds to the pet's size. The larger the pet is, the healthier the pet is.<br>
**Happiness** of the 'pet' corresponds to the pet's color. The more green the pet is, the happier the pet is.<br>

<br>

The pet's **Health** and **Happiness** decay over time and should be managed by giving the pet food or a toy. 
Food and toys can be given to the pet that either increase/decrease the pet's health or happiness
